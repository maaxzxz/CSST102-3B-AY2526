# 🧠 Student Lifestyle and Stress Level Prediction

## Activity Overview
This activity aims to analyze and predict **student stress levels** based on various **lifestyle factors** such as sleep duration, study habits, physical activity, and diet patterns. Using a **Logistic Regression model**, the experiment evaluates how well these factors can classify students into different stress categories (Low, Moderate, High). The model’s performance is assessed using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **5-Fold Cross-Validation**, along with a **confusion matrix** and **learning curve** visualization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used is **`student_lifestyle_dataset.csv`**, which contains several numerical and categorical features related to student habits and stress indicators.  
Key columns include:
- **Sleep Hours** – Average hours of sleep per day  
- **Study Hours** – Time spent studying daily  
- **Physical Activity** – Frequency or duration of exercise  
- **Social Interaction** – Time spent with peers or family  
- **Diet Quality** – Nutritional balance or meal regularity  
- **Stress_Level** – Target variable (Low, Moderate, High)

Before training, the dataset is split into **80% training** and **20% testing** sets to evaluate model generalization.
